# About the project
This project is a demo submission for the Google Nano Banana Hackathon. It showcases a Manga Creator AI application that empowers users to bring their stories to life. The application allows users to input their story ideas, which are then transformed into:

Detailed Storylines – AI expands raw ideas into structured plots with engaging narration.

Script Generation – Character dialogues, scene breakdowns, and narration panels are automatically created in manga-style format.

Manga-like Image Generation – Using Google Nano Banana’s image capabilities, the AI produces visually consistent, manga-inspired panels and characters that match the story flow.

This end-to-end system demonstrates how AI can streamline creative storytelling, enabling writers, artists, and fans to collaboratively generate manga experiences in minutes.
